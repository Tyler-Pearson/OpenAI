      <h2> Overview </h2>
      <p> The goal in making general game playing algorithms is to
          create a program that is able to successfully learn to play
          as many different kinds of games as possible. My approach is
          modeled after one published by sentdex (linked below). On a
          general level, it plays a large number of random games. From
          this population, it uses data from games that meets a
          certain score threshold to create a neural network that maps
          attributes of the current environment (ie user position,
          pole angle, cart velocity, etc) to the expected value of
          possible moves (ie move right, move left, etc). <br><br>

          The gifs below are screencaptures of sample runs of an agent
          playing different games with random moves (left side) vs a
          trained neural network agent playing the same games (right
          side). The pictures following those gifs show the scores of
          sample runs of a trained neural network agent. The first
          (left) is from CartPole with possible scores ranging from 0
          (worst) to 500 (best). Next (middle) is MountainCar, -500
          (worst) to 0 (best). Finally (right) Acrobot, -500 (worst) to
          0 (best). <br><br>

          Further details including my initial goal for the project,
          stumbling points, shortcomings and successes are provided in
          my project write-up (linked below). Apologies for the chaos
          and general messiness of this site, it was all thrown together
          on limited time and webdev experience! </p>
